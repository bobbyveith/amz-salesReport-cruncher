================== Orientation =================

This an ETL process. The program takes the Amazon sales report and transfroms the data to represent sales by Prefix and Suffix. 
The sales report doesn't provide product SKUs, so we get those from the All Listings Report and match (merge) the data together via the Child Sku.

--Inputs--
Sales Report: CSV - includes the units sold and total $ sales for each product which is represented by a Child ASIN.
All Listings Report: .txt - List of products on the amazon account, it provides the item SKU that correlates with each Child ASIN.

--Outputs--
full.csv - This is the full_df created by the program exported to a csv for easy review. Meant to be used just for test and dev.
            The sales Report and All Listings Report get outer joined on the Child ASIN column, and unwanted columns are dropped.
            This results in the full_df which is the finale of the 'extraction' part of the program. It represents all the input data correcly.

products.csv - This is meant to be used for test and dev only. Every record from the full_df gets initiated into the Product Class.
                Every object from the class has attributes derived from the full_df, and having it as a class object allows us to easily
                tranform the data as needed, and later represent the same data easily in different ways. 
                Every record in this csv is the representation of an object from the Product Class.
